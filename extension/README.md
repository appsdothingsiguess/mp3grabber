# YouTube Extension Test Guide

## What I've Fixed

Your extension wasn't working on YouTube because:

1. **YouTube doesn't use traditional audio elements** - YouTube uses complex video players with encrypted streams
2. **Missing permissions** - The extension needed specific host permissions for YouTube
3. **No YouTube-specific detection** - The original code only looked for direct audio file links

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `manifest.json`
- Added `host_permissions` for YouTube domains
- Added `content_scripts` for YouTube pages
- Added `storage` permission for future enhancements
- Updated version to 0.3

### 2. Created `content.js`
- YouTube-specific content script that runs on YouTube pages
- Detects video elements, blob URLs, and YouTube's internal data
- Provides better error messages and debugging info

### 3. Updated `bg.js`
- Added YouTube-specific detection function
- Enhanced command handler to detect YouTube pages
- Improved error messages and logging
- Added fallback mechanisms

## How to Test

1. **Reload the extension**:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click the reload button on your MP3 Grabber extension

2. **Test on YouTube**:
   - Go to any YouTube video
   - Wait for the video to fully load
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+M` (or your configured shortcut)
   - Check the browser console for detailed logs

3. **Check console logs**:
   - Press F12 to open Developer Tools
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for "MP3 Grabber:" messages

## Expected Behavior

- **On YouTube**: Should detect video streams, blob URLs, and YouTube's internal video data
- **On other sites**: Should work as before with direct audio file links
- **Console output**: Should show detailed information about what was found

## Troubleshooting

If it still doesn't work:

1. **Check console errors** - Look for any red error messages
2. **Try different videos** - Some videos may have different structures
3. **Wait for full load** - Make sure the video is completely loaded before testing
4. **Check permissions** - Ensure the extension has access to YouTube

## Limitations

- YouTube's video streams are often encrypted and may not be directly downloadable
- Some videos may not expose their stream URLs due to YouTube's security measures
- The extension can detect URLs but may not be able to access them due to CORS policies

## Next Steps

If you want to actually download YouTube videos, you'll need additional tools like:
- `yt-dlp` (command-line tool)
- `youtube-dl` (older version)
- Browser-based downloaders

The extension now provides the foundation for detecting YouTube content, but actual downloading requires additional implementation.
